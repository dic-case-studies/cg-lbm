# Color Gradient Lattice Boltzmann Simulator

This repo is a Color Gradient Lattice Boltzmann Method Simulator for immiscible fluids.

Based on `Subhedar, A. (2022). Color-gradient lattice Boltzmann model for immiscible fluids with density contrast. Physical review. E, 106 4-2, 045308 .`

## Examples

An example of running the simulation is present in [notebooks folder](./notebooks/Color%20Gradient%20Lattice%20Boltzman%20Method.ipynb)
